                            <p> Pho is a traditional Vietnamese dish, known for its fragrant broth, tender slices of beef or chicken, and soft rice noodles. It is often garnished with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and lime. </p>

                            <p> The rich flavors come from a slow-cooked broth made with spices such as star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. Served steaming hot, pho is both comforting and delicious. It is enjoyed as a breakfast staple or a hearty meal any time of the day. Add chili or hoisin sauce to enhance its taste. </p>

                            <p> Pho is not just a meal; itâ€™s a cultural symbol of Vietnam, loved worldwide for its unique combination of ingredients and satisfying flavor. </p>
